"""Practical Task 2: Analyzing and Visualizing E-Commerce Transactions with NumPy
Objective:
Develop a set of Python functions using NumPy to manipulate and analyze a simulated e-
commerce dataset.

Requirements:
    1. Array Creation:
        - Generate a multi-dimensional NumPy array with predefined values to simulate e-commerce transactions. The array should include transaction_id, user_id, product_id, quantity, price, and timestamp.
    2. Data Analysis Functions:
        - Total Revenue Function: Create a function to calculate the total revenue generated by multiplying quantity and price, and summing the result.
        - Unique Users Function: Develop a function to determine the number of unique users who made transactions.
        - Most Purchased Product Function: Implement a function to identify the most purchased product based on the quantity sold.
        - Type Casting and Checking Functions:
            - Create a function to convert the price array from float to integer.
            - Develop a function to check the data types of each column in the array.
    3. Array Manipulation Functions:
        - Product Quantity Array Function: Create a function that returns a new array with only the product_id and quantity columns.
        - User Transaction Count Function: Implement a function to generate an array of transaction counts per user.
        - Masked Array Function: Create a function to generate a masked array that hides transactions where the quantity is zero.
    4. Arithmetic and Comparison Functions:
        - Price Increase Function: Develop a function to increase all prices by a certain percentage (e.g., 5% increase).
        - Filter Transactions Function: Implement a function to filter transactions to only include those with a quantity greater than 1.
        - Revenue Comparison Function: Create a function to compare the revenue from two different time periods.
    5. Indexing and Slicing Functions:
        - User Transactions Function: Create a function to extract all transactions for a specific user.
        - Date Range Slicing Function: Develop a function to slice the dataset to include only transactions within a specific date range.
        - Top Products Function: Implement a function using advanced indexing to retrieve transactions of the top 5 products by revenue.
    6. Output Function:
        - Implement a separate function named print_array that takes an array and an optional message as input, and prints them to the console. This function will be used to display the state of the array, maintaining separation from the manipulation logic.
    7. Manipulation Workflow:
        - Call each analysis and manipulation function sequentially on the array. Use the print_array function to output arrays to the console with appropriate messages. Also output results to the console, when needed.
    8. Execution and Verification:
        - Test the script to ensure that all functions execute as expected and that the console outputs correctly display the changes to the array.
        - Use assertions to verify that the dimensions and integrity of the array are maintained or appropriately altered after each manipulation.

Deliverables:
A Python script (.py file) containing all the functions, along with the code to create the initial array and execute all manipulations.
